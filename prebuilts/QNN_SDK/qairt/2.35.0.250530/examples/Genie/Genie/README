Genie library source code example
---------------------------------

The Genie library (libGenie.so / Genie.dll) source code example provides users with an ability to recreate the Genie
library from source. Note that the Genie library source may be refactored, rewritten, or otherwise modified without
notice. The Genie C API is the commercially controlled and versioned interface that users should expect to be stable.
Please refer to the Genie SDK documentation tutorials at ${SDK_ROOT}/doc/Genie/ for more information on how to build the
sample code.
